### Registration Fees

* * *
  
Saline Crew is a club sport, and, like other club sports, it is supported and run by the families of the participating athletes.

**NOTE: Saline Crew is not part of Saline Area Schools "pay to play".**  
  
**NEW ROWERS - 1st Season ONLY - $375** (Program Registration Fees : $325, Rower Regatta Food $50.00)  
  
Fees are payable at the beginning of each season (note that there are two seasons, fall and spring). Seasonal dues pay for coaching salaries, insurance, gas, regatta fees, rower regatta food, boat maintenance, and other seasonal expenses. Dues for the Spring 2014 season are **$700.00** (Program Registration Fees : $650.00, Rower Regatta Food $50.00)  
  
Multiple Rower Discount (rowers from the same family):    

- 1st rower - 100% dues
- 2nd rower - 50% dues
- 3rd and above - 25% dues
  
Please follow [this link](http://www.payschools.com/cat.asp?id=C740BA23A6504DACBD07791491B63467) to pay your fees online.  
  
Questions: Jennifer’s email: [Treasurer](mailto:jennjohnson21@hotmail.com)   
  
**ADDITIONAL FEE:** Practice Transportation Fee of $75 Applies to "In-Season" Practices Only. if applicable*

*Parents and/or rowers who are providing their own transportation to and from practice do not need to pay the practice transportation fee. Also, if your rower is an approved driver, the practice transportation fee does not apply.*

The coaches will organize the "in-season" practice transportation car pools. They will assign rowers to specific cars and distribute funds to assigned drivers. Transportation Fee $75.00: **Payable to CASH** (Please give the cash and/or check to Coach Matt)  
  
_NOTE: We know this is not an inexpensive sport, so we have a program to help the rowers and their families offset the Club fees. Please see the [Rent-A-Rower](http://www.salinecrew.org/?module=Page&pageID=31) page for more information. The rowers get credit for each hour they work, and it can make a significant difference in the out-of-pocket costs for the fees._

### Crew Clothing

The only required clothing item is the Saline Unisuit by JL Racing. The rowers are required to wear the Unisuit at all regattas.  
  
There are numerous other clothing items available.

### Frequently Asked Questions

* * *

#### How much does crew cost?
It costs $700.00 to join the team. Plus travel costs for practices & regattas. [Get the specifics &gt;&gt;](http://www.salinecrew.org/?module=Page&pageID=42)   
  

#### Why does it cost so much?
Crew is a club sport so it receives no funding from the School athletic budget. The money from fees is used to buy equipment, pay for regatta fees, coaches salaries, transporting the boats and equipment etc.  
  

#### Are there scholarships
There are some limited scholarship funds available. Check with the[Coaches.](http://www.salinecrew.org/?module=Page&pageID=10)  
  

#### What safety rules apply?
All athletes must view a safety video and pass a swim test before being allowed on the water. Athletes must listen to the coaches, officials, and use common sense.  
What if I have never rowed before?  
  
Most students who join crew have never rowed before. We will teach you what you need to know so don't worry if you're new.  

#### What if I am not a good swimmer?
It is a rare occurrence for a rower to end up in the water. You will wear a life vest if you can't pass the swim test, plus the coaches carry additional flotation devices.  

#### Are there cuts?
There are no cuts for the team. However, the coach will decide which boats to place athletes in based on their skill, strength and the makeup of the team.  
What is the difference between fall rowing and spring rowing?  
  
The Fall season consists of longer races up to 5K (like cross country) and the Spring is Sprint Season with races of 1500 meters (like track).  
  
#### Do you have to row both in the fall and the spring?
No. You may row in either the Fall or the Spring or both; however, the Fall season is longer and this is when most athletes new to the sport learn to row. The Spring season happens fast and there is not as much time to learn the fundamentals of rowing in the Spring before races start.  
  
#### How do I get a varsity letter?
[Download the varsity letter requirements&gt;&gt;](http://www.salinecrew.org/images/downloads/crewvarsitystandards.pdf)  
  
#### When do we practice?
After school on weekdays or early morning on Saturdays.  
  
#### Where do we practice?
On Ford Lake at the Boathouse site.    

#### How do you get to practice?
We carpool over and most drivers are students. [Get more specifics&gt;&gt;](http://www.salinecrew.org/?module=Page&pageID=16)  
  
#### Where are the regattas?
In Michigan and Ohio.[ Check out the Regatta schedule&gt;&gt;](http://www.salinecrew.org/?module=Page&pageID=94)  
  
#### What equipment do I need?
The only required item is the team uni. We recommend that you dress in layers and wear warm clothing such as under armour and/or spandex (surprisingly comfortable) under your workout clothing.  
  
#### What uniforms do I have to buy?
For your first season, we provide a tshirt. In subsequent seasons, you need to buy our unisuit which is on our [order form](http://www.salinecrew.org/images/downloads/Spring%202011%20Order%20Form.pdf) . Most athletes also purchase a sweatshirt and sweatpants to wear before and after races.  

#### Who are the coaches?
Matt LeBlanc, Head Coach [boatrepair@comcast.net](mailto:boatrepair@comcast.net)  
[](mailto:boatrepair@comcast.net)  

#### Do I have to be a certain height?
There are no height minimums, although taller athletes may have a mechanical advantage. There is also a position called coxswain who is critical to the boat’s success because they are responsible for steering and executing race strategy. The coxswain tends to be shorter and lighter than the other athletes rowing the boat.  
  
#### What is lightweight rowing?
For men, lightweight rowers must weigh less than 165 pounds in Fall, 150 pounds or less in spring.  
  
For women, lightweight rowers are less than 135 pounds in the Fall and 130 pounds in the Spring.  
  
#### Can parents and sibling eat the food at regattas?
Yes, our food coordinator will plan enough for athletes, parents and siblings. The rower's food is included in the combined fee paid at the beginning of each season. The families and guests need to go online and pay the $10.00 per guest per regatta (18 and under are $5). We only ask that you give first priority to athletes as they are on a tight schedule to get prepared and race.  
  

#### Who runs the team?  
[The Coaches, Board of Directors and all of the parent volunteers.](http://www.salinecrew.org/?module=Page&pageID=15)  
  
#### Are there bylaws?
[Yes](http://www.salinecrew.org/images/FORMS/Saline%20Rowing%20Club%20Bylaws%20update%205%2020%202014.pdf)

### Transportation

* * *
  
Parents are expected to carpool to and from regattas. Transportation to and from practice can be arranged with an approved driver student by paying the transportation fee for each season. A parent or coach schedules practice transportation and another volunteer parent manages the regattas' transportation information.  
  
Athletes cannot drive to and from regattas, but can drive to and from practices with a signed parent transportation authorization form on file. Approved students who drive the carpools to/from practice are reimbursed for their mileage.  
  
Communication regarding regatta transportation is sent via email a week prior.  
  
Transportation coordination is a very important role and requires a lot of cooperation and communication from parents to be sure all of rowers have transportation. Please be sure to do your part.

### How to enjoy a Crew Regatta

* * *
  
#### Before the Regatta……
  
**Weather:** During the season <www.weather.com> is your friend! It is great as you can check the forecast in advance and get the hour to hour details which will help you in packing the appropriate clothes.  
  
**What to pack:** Even if the weather channel calls for great weather, the temperature by and on the water can be very different. Be prepared!

**For Spectators:**  

  - Folding chairs 
  - Binoculars 
  - Sunglasses 
  - Layers of clothes 
  - Reading material 
  - Camera 
  
**For the Rowers:**  

  - Sleeping Bags (one per rower) 
  - Boots – many sites get very muddy!! 
  - A towel 
  - Plastic Bags for wet clothes 
  - Extra food (even though the team stocks up and there is plenty, if your rower likes a certain sports drink or energy bar you will want to bring it). 
  - Water Bottles 
  - Hats/Gloves in the Fall/early spring 
  - Extra clothes including a pair of dry socks for each race, clothes to change into afterwards. Some like to wear wool socks. 
  - Hat to keep the sun off in the Spring/early Fall 
  - Long/Short sleeve shirt to fit under tank or uni
  - Sweat Pants 
  
Sometimes packing all of the “stuff” in a laundry basket keeps things portable and compact.  
  
Snacks for traveling home – your rower is usually starving at the end!  
  
Be sure that your rower’s clothing is labeled. Remember, everyone has the same team sweatshirt and many items get left behind.  
  
Print off heat sheets before you go! For most races these can be found on[www.regattacentral.com](http://www.salinecrew.org/www.regattacentral.com) click on the event and then on the tab on the left labeled “heat sheet” a few days before the regatta. Highlight your team’s/rower’s races. Some regattas will sell them for $2 or $3 at the site, but they go fast.  
  
Be sure to print off directions and important phone numbers like the other drivers prior to leaving!  
  
#### The night before the regatta,

Set at least two alarms!! If you stay in a hotel, ask for a wake up call, but also set at least one back up!!! I have had the experience where we asked for a wake up call, and they forgot. If we hadn’t set an extra alarm we would have been late (does not make for happy rowers or coaches)!

#### Arriving at the regatta…..

Plan to arrive early! This will help you get a good parking spot and your rower has alot to do before the first race of the day, even if they don’t race until noon!  
  
It is best to just let your rower go once you are parked and let them find their teammates. Again they have a lot to do.  
  
Once you do arrive, you may not see or talk to your rower much that day. This is OK!! They are under the watchful eyes of the coaches and captains. Again, they have many responsibilities, besides racing, including rigging/de-rigging, dock support and cheering on their team. If they are busy, that means they are being a good teammate!  
  
Plan to stay ALL DAY!!! Racing usually starts at 8:00am and doesn’t end until around 5pm. This is dependent on many factors, including number of teams, races, heats, and weather. Regattas rarely run right on time. ALL team members are required to stay for the ENTIRE regatta, and are not dismissed until the Coaches have dismissed the whole team!  
  
*If you think that you have a conflict and your rower may have to leave early, please let the coaches know at least a week in advance. Entries for most regattas have to be in a week before the race, and changes are not usually permitted. A rower leaving early or not attending could mean that 4 or 8 other rowers may not race!!*  
  
#### The tent…..

The team has several tents. The big yellow tent is generally reserved for the rowers. Little siblings are usually welcomed as well. This is where they put their gear, sit and relax and be a team.  
  
There are food tents manned by parent volunteers. All members of the team, including family members are welcome to eat. There is usually a wonderful assortment of breakfast, lunch and snack items available, as well as Gatorade, water and hot chocolate.  
  
Parents usually hang out here and then get closer to the water to watch their rower. This is a great place to meet new friends!  
  
#### Watching the regatta……..

During the Fall season: These are called “Head Races.” Races are longer (similar to Cross Country), usually 2.5 to 3 miles long. Boats are started in approximately 30 second intervals. Depending on the course, you may only get to see a very small portion of your rower’s race. And, you will not have any idea on how they did until the end of the day. You can watch their “bow number” and see where they are in relation to the other boats, but it is still difficult to figure out really how they did until the results are posted on the board.  
  
Spring Season: These are called “Sprints”. The course is usually 1500 or 2000 meters long. That is one of the reasons they do all of those lovely “2Ks” in winter training. These are easier, in many ways, to watch as it is true head to head competition. This is where the binoculars come in handy! Also our oar colors are black or yellow. Many parents look at the oars to see if they are our boats.  
  
After you watch your rower’s race, as happy and proud as you are, don’t approach them. When ready and able they will come to you. – Really they will! After they get off the water, they immediately have a boat meeting with the Coaches. This is a no parent zone! (Same goes for the boat meeting right before their race). The rower will then go get food and use the bathroom and then may find you. But if they don’t remember, it is OK!  
  
#### Other “No parent Zones”:

  - On the Docks – This is an extremely busy place. 
  - Rigging/De-rigging boats – The rowers are very busy during these times and the equipment is large and expensive!
 

**Taking pictures**: It is often hard to take good clear pictures as the boats are large and moving fast, but taking pictures is strongly encouraged! Your best opportunity to take pictures is when they are leaving or returning to the docks, Loading the boat, or getting the boats ready to race. Candids are great! If you do take pictures talk to a Board Member. The team gathers as many photos as possible during the season to use for newspaper articles, the end of the season video and we usually hand out a CD-ROM with all of the pictures we can gather at the banquet!  

**Cheering for your rower**: They say they can’t hear us, but cheer loud anyway!!!! Especially as they approach!  
  
**T-shirts**: Every regatta has a t-shirt for sale. This will usually cost between $15 - $25. These are nice and good mementos of the season. Often parents have keepsake quilts made out of the shirts when their rower graduates. Some regattas also sell rowing jewelry. These make great gifts!  
  
#### At the end of the regatta……..

  - Take a few moments to make sure your rower has everything, sweats, shirts, hats etc.!!!
  - Help take down the tents and pack up the food trailer.
  - Most rowers sleep on the way home! Make sure you can stay awake for the drive.
  - Most importantly! Congratulate your rower on a great day!!! No matter the outcome!!

Finally, **ENJOY** every minute of watching your child/children participate in a truly unique sport! It is worth the early starts, long days and ever changing weather. It will too soon be the last race of their Senior Season, and you will wonder where did it go? The lessons they learn as part of the team will serve them well beyond high school!  
    
Row Hard Hornets!!
